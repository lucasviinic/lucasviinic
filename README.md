# Hello folks! 👋

#### I'm a Full Stack Developer, computer science student and, in short i,

- 📚 I'm always studying new technologies and analyzing their potential in professional and personal projects.
- 👨‍💻 Currently, working with Flutter on the front-end and, on the back-end, working with Go and Python!
- 🔥  When I get excited about a project, I stay up all night and it's no surprise that there are commits in the middle of Saturday/Sunday. The result is always rewarding.
- 🎯 Big problems don't intimidate me, programming for me is a way of life.
