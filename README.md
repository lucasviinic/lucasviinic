# Hello folks! 👋

#### I'm a Software Developer, computer science student and, in short i,

- 👨‍💻 Currently, I work as a Back-end Developer, primarily using the Ruby language, the non-relational database MongoDB, among other technologies.
- 📚 I'm always studying new technologies and analyzing their potential in professional and personal projects.
- 🔥 I'm dedicated to working on personal projects, so it's common for me to commit code late at night or on weekends 😅
- 🎯 Big problems don't intimidate me, programming for me is a way of life.
